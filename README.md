# Apple Website Clone

Welcome to the **Apple Clone** project! 🚀 I recreated the sleek, modern Apple website using the latest web dev technologies. The goal? A responsive, interactive, and visually stunning experience with animations, authentication, and 3D models.


## What’s Inside? ✨
- **Responsive Design**: Looks amazing on any screen size 📱💻
- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth, dynamic animations that bring the site to life 🎬
- **3D Models**: Interactive elements powered by Three.js 🌍
- **Authentication**: Firebase + reCAPTCHA for secure login 🔐
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - **Frontend**: React.js
  - **Tools**: Firebase, Three.js, GSAP
